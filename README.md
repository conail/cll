# CLL: Conway's Life Log

A experient using Conway's Game of Life to explore spatio-temporal calculus.

## Concepts 

### Choros, Topos & Chronos

Place as a static spatial meaningful organization in time.

- Time Sampling and Reality Representation Protocol
  - Regular Time Sampling Protocol
  - Released Observation
  - Organically Linked Observation
- Time Structures
  - Order
  - Time Line Structure
  - Time Reversibility
  - Time Semantics
  - User Time
  - State, Events
  - States Set
  - Temporal Operators
- Features
  - Permanent Features
  - Modifiable Spatial Features (Split and Merge)
  - Varying Features (Creeping Features)
  - Changing Spatial Features (Creeping, Split and Merge Features)
- Representation
  - Intervals
  - Instants

## Process

1. Management - what control
2. Planning - what action
3. Prediction - what-if
4. Reasoning - why, how
5. Exploration - what, where, when
